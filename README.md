# Excel-Dashboard
In this project, I focused on transforming raw data into visual graphics for easier interpretation. I cleaned the data to eliminate inaccuracies and extracted relevant insights for the company. The primary objective was to analyze customer purchasing behavior.

Key metrics examined included:

Loyalty status
Average spending by age group
Total purchases by region
Purchase frequency by product category
Purchase amounts relative to income
These insights are designed to help organizations make informed decisions that enhance customer service while ensuring financial sustainability.
